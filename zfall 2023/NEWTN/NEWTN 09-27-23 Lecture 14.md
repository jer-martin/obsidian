<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%;">Map of the Ceque system</div>


- The *ceques* related different parts of the Inca civilization; social status, religion, and calendar to things they considered sacred
- Astronomy was only part of this equation:
	- Ceque #6 of Chincaysuyu has "pillars, which serve to signal the beginning of summer when the sun arrives there"
	- Ceque #8 "had two pillars to signal when the sun arrived; this indicated the commencement of the sowing of maize"
- There were a total of 41 ceques comprising 328 huacas → calendar

- Each huaca corresponds to one day; 328 days in a year
- 37 uncounted days are in the period of the invisibility of the Pleiades (near Sun) → 365 total

- They don't move with the stars, they are outliers
- Planets rise in the east and set in the west (5 easily visible)
- *Planet* means *wanderer*

- Apparent motion relative to the stars
