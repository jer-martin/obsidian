## Stonehenge

### Source of the Sarsen Stones
- Marlborough Hills
	- ~20 miles away

- Preseli Hills, Wales

- Bluestone outcrops are formed of natural, vertical pillars that can be removed by inserting wedges into the ready-made joints between pillars.
- 2019 finding shows that stones were quarried at the site about 5000 years ago
- Archaeologists are now evaluating a change in the timeline of the Henge, with the blue stones being placed in the Aubrey holes creating the first Henge and the Sarsen stones arriving later


*William Stukeley - *
	"The principal line of the whole work points to the NE, where the sun is when the days are longer."


### Hawkins's Results
- Midwinter = winter solstice
- Midsummer = summer solstice
- Declinations determine whether the Moon is in a standstill

### Hawkins's Theory on Predicting Eclipses
- At intervals 9,9, 10, 9, 9, 10 place alternating black and white marker stones
- Move them clockwise around the ring one hole per year
- If white marker falls in holes 56, 51, or 5, eclipse is possible that ear
	- For example, white marker at AH56, full moon rises over heel stone

### Hawkins's Most Controversial Result
- Lunar standstills as a tool to predict eclipses
- Aubrey holes could be used with marker stones as a "computer"

### Arguments against Aubrey Holes as "Eclipse Computer"
- Number of holes:
	- 56 holes is practically unique to Stonehenge (other megalithic structures have holes, but different number)
- 56 years is not recognizable as an eclipse cycle
- Standstill cycle is about 18.6 years and cannot be used to make long term predictions of lunar eclipses
	- Metonic cycle (19 years) is much more useful

### Criticism of Hawkins
- Every age has the Stonehenge it deserves - or desires (tendency to imbue it with out own ideas and purposes)
	- modern "Druids" and New Age
	- Inigo Jones's reconstruction of Stonehenge that looked like a Roman temple
- Archaeological assessment of Bronze Age people doesn't indicate knowledge of the Moon cycle at this level
- *Alignments found not necessarily intentional*
	- However, the probability of standstill alignments of sun and moon by chance is very small (1 in 2 million)
- Using the Sun as a calendar and the Moon's phases to keep track of tides is *very different* than predicting astrological events

**Stonehenge is not an isolated monument**
- A complex of hundreds of structures cover about 4.5 miles with Stonehenge near center


### Rare Flint Rock
- Flint on the nearby river turns pink when dry due to an algae

## Probable Astronomical Alignments
- Rising and setting standstills of the Moon and Sun (calendar)
- Moon used to track tides
