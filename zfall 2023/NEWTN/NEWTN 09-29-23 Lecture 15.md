# Inferior and Superior Planets
*Two groups of planets based on motion:*
- Inferior
	- Closer to Sun than Earth is
- Superior
	- Farther from Sun than Earth is

- A complete revolution of a planet on its orbit relative to a star is the *sidereal period*
	→ Venus' is 225 days
	→ Earth's is 365.25 days

- Interval between successive occurrences of given configuration relative to the Sun (including heliacal rising) is *synodic period*
	→ Venus - 584 days before the same configuration is repeated
		- Important for Mayan calendar

- Transit is possible during inferior conjunction

- Venus is Morning Star at greatest Western elongation

- Superior planets elongation can be as much as 180$\textdegree$ during quadrature

- Interval between successive occurrences of given configuration (including heliacal rising) is *synodic period*
	→ Superior planet: Mars ~ 780 days (some variation due to eccentricity of orbit)
	→ Venus ~ 584 days


## Retrograde Motion
- Like the Sun, planets usually appear to move eastward relative to the stars
- As we pass by them in our orbit (opposition), they move west relative to the stars for a few weeks or months
- This is noticeable over many nights

- Easy for *us* to explain: occurs when we "lap" another planet (or when Mercury or Venus laps us)
- Very difficult to explain if you believe the Earth doesn't move!

## Periods in Mayan History
- Pleistocene (c. 13,000-7,500 BCE)
- Archaic Period (c. 7500-2000 BCE)
	- Mayan and Olmecs very similar until 1000 BC
- Pre-classic (c. 2000 BCE - 250 CE)
	- Mayans begin to build ritual areas, develop distinct language
- Classic (c. 250 - 900 CE)
	- End of classical - Mayan decline
		- Warfare, deforestation, and climate change
- Post-classic (900 - Spanish first arrival)
	- By 950 about 90 to 95% of Mayans had died
- Mayan conquest (c. 1541 - 1542)
- Mesoamerican Colonial Period (c. 1542 - 1824)

The Spanish destroyed all of the Mayan writings, believing them to be the work of the Devil.

## Mayan Decline
- Some studies point to deforestation and climate change
- Population > 19 million
- Evidence of severe drought
- Deforestation (agriculture and fuel for fires to cook plaster)
- Computer model showed that a cleared landscape reduced absorption of solar radiation → less water → less crops → less food

## Mayan Archaeological Sites
- Majority of the important sites are within the Lowlands
- Tikal was the most important of the classical period
	- Taken by the Snake Kings in the 600s
- We will cover the cities of Uaxactun, Uxmal, and Chichen Itza

## Alignments
- Uaxactun (Eight Stones)
	- In Guatemala
	- 500-900 AD
