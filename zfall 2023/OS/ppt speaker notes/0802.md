# Filesystem Block Management Lecture Outline

## Introduction to Block Management
- Explanation of blocks as addressable units of memory for read and modify operations.
## Effects of Block Size
- Trade-off between Disk Utilization and Data Rate.
- Impact of bigger block sizes on data rates and disk utilization.
- Comparison of larger vs. smaller block sizes.

## Typical Block Size
- Historical perspective on average file sizes.
- Rationale behind the 4KB block size standard.

## Block Size and Partition Size
- Correlation between block size and the maximum partition size.
- Examples with FAT-12, FAT-16, and FAT-32 filesystems.

## Tracking Free Blocks
- Importance of fast allocation and deallocation of blocks.
- Methods to track free blocks:
  - Linked lists
  - Bitmaps

## Linked List Strategy
- Management of free blocks using a linked list in main memory and disk.
- The potential inefficiency of constant disk and memory IO.

## Filesystem Consistency
- The necessity of file system consistency checks post-crash.
- The role of block caching in maintaining consistency.

## Block Consistency Checks
- Methodology for checking block consistency using counters.
- States of consistency and solutions to inconsistencies:
  - Consistent state
  - Missing block
  - Duplicate block in the free list
  - Duplicate data block
