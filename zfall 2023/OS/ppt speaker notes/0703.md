# Filesystem Allocation Methods Lecture Outline

## Introduction
- Continuation of filesystem exploration
- Focus on file allocation methods

## File Allocation Methods
- Contiguous
- Linked
- Chained
- Indexed
- Hybrid methods
  - Chained indexed
  - Multi-level indexed

## File Allocation Operations
- Read block at index "k"
- Write block at index "k"
- Allocate
- Deallocate

## Contiguous File Allocation
- Files stored in sequential order
- Fast performance for reading successive blocks
- Issues with storage allocation:
  - Fragmentation
  - Over-estimation leads to wasted space
  - Under-estimation may require file movement

## Linked List Allocation
- Blocks contain pointers to the next block
- No external fragmentation
- Allows dynamic file growth
- Not efficient for random access files
- Linked allocation drawbacks:
  - Space consumed by links
  - Reliability concerns (pointer loss or damage)

## Chained Table Allocation (FAT)
- Variation of linked allocation
- All links stored in a separate table
- Cached in memory for improved random access

## Indexed Allocation
- Indexes combined into a disk block for each file
- Space considerations for the index block
- Pure index system limitations on file size
- Example calculation with 32-bit pointers and 1KiB blocks

## Multi-Level Indexed Allocation
- Primary index block points to secondary index blocks
- File size capabilities with two levels of indexing

## Chained Indexed Allocation
- Pointer to another index block for extended file size
- Reduction in wasted space

## Combined Scheme (UNIX inodes)
- Direct pointers stored in the inode
- Singly, doubly, and triply indirect pointers for large files
- Advantages for small and huge files

## Additional Information on Storage Allocation
- Optimal allocation method varies
  - Sequential vs. random access
  - Small vs. large files
- Systems may adjust allocation methods for optimal performance
