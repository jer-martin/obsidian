#### **Key Concepts**

- **Input/Output Devices**: Devices that allow computer systems to receive and share information. Examples include keyboards, mice, gamepads, screens, speakers, etc.
- **Data Storage Devices**: Also considered I/O devices (e.g., solid-state drives, spinning disks, tapes).
- **Environmental Sensors**: Common in smartphones, capture temperature, pressure, lighting levels.
- **Video and Audio Recorders**: Also categorized as I/O devices.

#### **Operating System's Role**

- Provides access to diverse I/O devices via uniform interfaces.
- Categorizes I/O devices into block devices and character devices.

#### **Device Types**

1. **Block Devices**
    - Random access to data organized in fixed-size blocks.
    - Examples: Hard drives, CD drives, RAM disks.
    - Generally faster and more performant than character devices.
2. **Character Devices**
    - No physically addressable storage media.
    - I/O performed by a byte stream.
    - Examples: Keyboard, mouse.

#### **Device Data Reach**

- **Raw Data Rate**: Total number of bits transferred per second, including protocol overhead.
- **Effective Data Rate**: Data transfer capacity excluding communication protocol overhead.
- **Burst Data Rate**: Maximum transmission rate for a short time frame.
- **Sustained Data Rate**: Average transfer rate over an extended period.

#### **Data Transfer Rates**

- Calculation example using IBM 2400 tape drive.
- Factors in speed: inches per second, bits per inch per track, number of tracks.

#### **I/O Handling**

- **Programmed I/O**: CPU handles all I/O operations; can impact system performance.
- **Co-processor Use**: Frees CPU to perform other tasks while I/O operations are ongoing.

#### **I/O Communication**

- **Memory Addressing**: I/O devices write to memory addresses to communicate.
- **Isolated Addressing**: Separate read/write control lines for I/O; isolated address space.

#### **Approaches to Handle I/O**

1. **Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO)**
    - Uses same address space for memory and I/O devices.
    - Example: Commodore 64 memory space.
2. **Port-Mapped I/O (PMIO)**
    - Uses special CPU instructions for I/O.
    - Separate address space for I/O devices.
3. **Dynamic Memory Access (DMA)**
    - Co-processor accesses main memory independently of the CPU.
4. **Dedicated Channel I/O**
    - High-performance architecture, more common in mainframe computers.
