**1. (a) Briefly explain the original leading theory before this newer work was published for how Mercury was trapped in a 3/2 resonance instead of rotating synchronously. What problem caused the scientists to question this theory?**

- The leading theory was that the planet's moderate orbital eccentricity caused Mercury to get caught in the tidal forces of the Sun. This theory required that Mercury initially spun quickly in a prograde direction and the tidal forces caused the planet to slow. However, this results in only a 26% chance that Mercury ended up in a 3/2 resonance, and a much higher chance of ending up in a higher order resonance.

**(b) Briefly explain the newly proposed theory for how Mercury was trapped in a 3/2 resonance instead of rotating synchronously.**

- The new theory is that Mercury originally rotated in a retrograde direction, giving the planet a 68% chance of locking into an orbital resonance. From there, a large impact could have shifted the resonance to be 3/2 spin/orbit. Alternatively, the impactors could have shifted the resonance slightly, and if Mercury happened to enter a period of higher eccentricity, then the resonance would have stabilized at 3/2.

**(c) What observational evidence supports this new theory?**

- There is evidence from observing the placement and quantity of impact craters on the face of Mercury that show that at one point it *did* rotate synchronously. There are also craters that are big enough to where they could have caused the change in resonance.

**2. Read section 10.1.1 in the textbook and visit this website: https://ytliu0.github.io/Mercury-SpinOrbitResonance/mercury.html What weird effect is pointed out about the motion of the Sun as viewed from Mercury and why does this occur?**

- There is a point in which the Sun (from an observer's perspective on Mercury) would move retrograde across the sky (west to east). This is caused by Mercury's large orbital eccentricity, which causes the sun to move relative to the horizon with an oscillating angular speed. At perihelion, the Sun would move 0.2 degrees per day *retrograde*.
