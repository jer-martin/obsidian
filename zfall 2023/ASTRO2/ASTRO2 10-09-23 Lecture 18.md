## Chapter 12: The Solar System Perspective (Exoplanets)

### Calculating Basic Exoplanet Characteristics
- The mass of the planet from Doppler
$$M_{B}\approx(\frac{4\pi^{2}M^{2}_{A}}{GP^{2}}a^{3}_{A})^\frac{1}{3}$$
- But we don't actually measure $v_{a}\text{sin(i)}$. Substitute these in and solve...
$$P=\frac{2\pi a_{A}}{v_{a}}$$
$$M_{b}\text{sin }i\approx\frac{M^{2}_{A}P}{2\pi G}^{\frac{1}{3}}v_{a}\text{sin }i$$

##### Doppler: The Velocity and Mass are Lower Limits
- $V_{a}$ is really $V_{a}\text{sin }i$
	→ $M_{B}$ is also really $M_{B}\text{sin }i$

### Transit Method
- Measure brightness with a light curve

*What does the flux drop depend on?*
$$ \frac{\delta F}{F}=\frac{\pi R^{2}_{b}}{\pi R^{2}_{a}}=\frac{R_{b}}{R_{a}}^2$$

*We can also get $R_{a,b}$ from transit times:*
$$R_{B,A}=\frac{1}{2}v_{B}\Delta t_{1,2}$$
	→ $\Delta t_{1}$ = 1st - 2nd contact
	→ $\Delta t_{2}$ = 1st - 3rd contact

*We can get $v_{B}$ by assuming a circular orbit and applying Kepler's Third:*

$$v_{B}\approx \frac{2\pi a_{B}}{P}\approx \frac{2\pi GM_{A}}{P}^\frac{1}{3}$$
