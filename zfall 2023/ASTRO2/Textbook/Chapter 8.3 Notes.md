# Formation of the Solar System
- Star formation occurs when a large gas cloud collapses under its own gravity
	- this can only happen when self-gravity force outweighs support provided by gas pressure
	- only occurs in dense, cold ($T \lessapprox 10K$) regions of interstellar gas
- If the gas cloud has net angular momentum, it will form a rotationally supported disk
	- this is known as a *protoplanetary disk*
	- stars form out of the middle
	- planets form out of the edges

### Steps of Planet Formation
1. Condensation
	- formation of solid particles within the gaseous disk as it cools
	- solids grow molecule by molecule
	- materials that condense at low temperatures are called *volatile materials*
	- materials that condense at high temperatures are called *refractory materials*
2. Accretion
	- solid condensates are held together by weak electrical forces
	- these "snowflakes" gently collide until forming a *planetesimal*
		- near the Sun, planetesimals are made of the least volatile materials
		- as the medium gets cooler, planetesimals get more mixed
3. Coalescence
	- planetesimals are drawn together to form larger bodies
	- due to only low-volatility materials being able to condense close to the sun, the planets built by coalescence within 1.5 AU of the sun are rich in low-volatility elements (though they are relatively rare)
	- protoplanets grow by combining planetesimals until they reach a mass of $M \approx 15 M_{âŠ•}$ , when they start condensing hydrogen and helium
4. Chemical Differentiation 
	- dense elements sink into the center and less dense elements float to the surface
	- cores of terrestrial planets have uncompressed densities of ~9000 $kgm^{-3}$, while their outer layers have ~3000 $kgm^{-3}$ 
5. 1. Cratering (Terrestrial)
	- begins as new planets sweep up remaining planetesimals
	- important process until about 3.3 billion years ago
5. 2. Volcanic flooding (Terrestrial)
	- occurs at the same time as cratering
6. Magnetic field formation
