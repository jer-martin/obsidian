- Mercury is difficult to view from Earth due to it never being more than 30$\textdegree$ from the Sun
	- This difficulty is the reason for our mistakes about it's rotation

### $P_{rot}=\text{58.65 days}$ 
### $P_{orb}=\text{87.97 days}$ 

### *What does this tell us?*
###  $P_{rot} = \frac{2}{3}P_{orb}$ 

 *In other words, the time it takes Mercury to go twice around the Sun, it completes three full rotations about it's axis. Therefore, the length of the solar day on Mercury is:*
### $P_{sol} = (\frac{1}{P_{rot}} - \frac{1}{P_{orb}})^{-1} = (\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{P_{orb}} - \frac{1}{P_{orb}})^{-1}$  

The *rotation period* and the *orbital period* of Mercury are ***commensurate***. This means that their ratio is the ratio of two small integers.
- This is a result of the large eccentricity of Mercury's orbit $(e = 0.206),$ combined with the fact the planet is not perfectly spherical.

The bulging and gravitational effects of Mercury allowed *Mariner 10* and *MESSENGER* to get accurate mass calculations, despite the fact that it has no natural satellite. Using these calculation, we discovered:
### $\rho = \text{5400 kg m}^{-3}$ 

This indicates that Mercury has an unusually large iron core. To achieve that density, Mercury must have a skimpy 600 km thick mantle of rock above a core that is ~1800 kilometers in radius.
