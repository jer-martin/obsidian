## Examining Orbits
- What else do we use orbits to calculate?
	- They enable us to calculate the enclosed mass!
	- Orbiting objects using Kepler's Third
$$M_{MW}(M_{ ⊙ }) = \frac{a_{AU^{3}}}{ P_{yr^{2}}} \approx 9.3 \times 10^{10} M_{ ⊙ }$$
		→ Using satellite galaxies/globular clusters:
		$$M_{MW}= 15 \times 10^{11} M_{⊙}$$
$$L_{MW}= 2.3 \times 10^{10} L_{⊙} ... \frac{M_{MW}}{L_{MW}}=65!$$

## What is this Extra "Dark Matter"
- Neutrinos: < few % of the total mass
- MACHOs (MAssive Compact Halo Objects): brown dwarfs (mass between biggest planets and smallest stars), white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, etc: ~20%
- Non-baryonic matter such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles): interact only through the weak nuclear force and gravity
- MOND: $F_{g} \cancel{\propto} R^{2}$ (at large R?)
	- No hints that GR is wrong
	→ We don't know!

# Chapter 20
### What are these "spiral nebulae"?
#### The "Great Debate"
- Shapley: Spiral nebulae: gas clouds within out galaxy or small satellite galaxies orbiting our own galaxy
- Curtis: Spiral nebulae: distant, large galaxies far outside of our own galaxy
	- Harlow Shapley vs Heber Curtis
