The galactic disk has two components:
- Thin disk: stars of all ages, mostly metal rich (Population 1)
- Thick disk: stars older than 5 Gyr, mostly metal poor (Population 2)

### Galaxies with unorganized orbital motions
- Where do we observe unorganized orbital revolution?
	- Bulge/halo of the galaxies (as with the Milky Way) and elliptical galaxies
- For a system where the stellar motions are in equilibrium (you can take an ensemble average of orbits) use the virial theorem
$2K = -U$
- kinetic energy
$K = \sum\limits^{N}_{n=1} \frac{1}{2} m_{i}v_{i}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}M<v^{2}>$ 
	- where v^2 is the mass-weighted mean square velocity
- Potential energy
$U ~ -\frac{GM^{2}}{r}\approx -0.4 \frac{GM^{2}}{r_{h}}$
	- where r_h is half light/mass radius
$M\approx 2.5 \frac{<v^{2}>r_{h}}{G}$

### Orbital influence of SMBH
- How do we determine the point at which a star's orbit is controlled by the SMBH
- $r_{BH}=\frac{GM_{BH}}{\sigma^{2}_{*}}\approx 11 \text{pc}(\frac{M_{BH}}{10^{8} M_{sun}})(\frac{\sigma_{*}}{200\text{ km/s}})$
