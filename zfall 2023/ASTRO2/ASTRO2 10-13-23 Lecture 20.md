## Special Relativity
### The Nature of Sound
- Sound waves are particle group compressions
- No particles in space, no medium to propagate through

### What Exactly Is A Light Wave?
- A small disturbance in an electric field which creates a small magnetic field, which creates an electric field, and so on
*Unanswered questions before relativity:*
	→ What medium do light waves travel through?
	→ How is the speed of light waves changing as you move through the medium?
