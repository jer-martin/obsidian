## Dining Philosophers
- Circular deadlock
	- This is a pattern in which a process blocks while waiting for a resource that is being held by another process

In this problem, there are 5 philosophers sitting around a table. They are all thinking, eating, or waiting
  
When they **think** they *do not* hold any chopsticks. To **eat**, they need to *acquire the chopstick that is to their right **and** the chopstick that is to their left*. If they can *only get one of the chopsticks*, they **wait**.

- Naive implementations lead to deadlock

Concurrency
- No assumptions may be made about how long any process takes in the critical section (eating) or processing other tasks (thinking)

Safety
- Any two processes that are not logically adjacent can run its critical section simultaneously

Liveliness
- A process that is not running its critical section cannot prevent another process from it's critical section
