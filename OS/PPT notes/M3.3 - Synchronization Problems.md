## Dining Philosophers
- Circular deadlock
	- This is a pattern in which a process blocks while waiting for a resource that is being held by another process

In this problem, there are 5 philosophers sitting around a table. They are all thinking, eating, or waiting
  
When they **think** they *do not* hold any chopsticks. To **eat**, they need to *acquire the chopstick that is to their right **and** the chopstick that is to their left*. If they can *only get one of the chopsticks*, they **wait**.

- Naive implementations lead to deadlock

Concurrency
- No assumptions may be made about how long any process takes in the critical section (eating) or processing other tasks (thinking)

Safety
- Any two processes that are not logically adjacent can run its critical section simultaneously

Liveliness
- A process that is not running its critical section cannot prevent another process from it's critical section


#### Algorithm 1: pass directly

- If everybody passes to the left, then everyone tries to take it from the right. This causes a circular block.

*TO SOLVE:*
Processes must relinquish resources if they can't execute their critical section.

Note:
- Track all states
- getRight and getLeft, as well as takeBothHashi

Lets look at this algorithm:
- Main loop is infinite while
- Every process begins by thinking deeply
- if someone needs to eat, they attempt takeBothHashi
- if they can take both, they eat, and drop both hashi when done


## Producer Consumer
Concurrency
- Producers and consumers act in parallel
- Multiple producers and consumers should be able to read the buffer at one time
- No assumptions made about speed

Safety
- Never can two producers write to the same buffer entry at the same time
- Never can two consumers read from the same entry at the same time
- Never can a consumer read from an entry while a producer is writing to it

Liveness
- No process not currently writing to or reading from an entry may prevent another process from finding an entry
- No process must wait indefinitely to obtain access to an entry as long as entries are available

Correctness
- No entry shall be overwritten with a new item before the previous item is removed.
- No empty entry shall be read by a consumer.
