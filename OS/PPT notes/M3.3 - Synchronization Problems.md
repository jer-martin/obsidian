## Dining Philosophers
- Circular deadlock
	- This is a pattern in which a process blocks while waiting for a resource that is being held by another process

In this problem, there are 5 philosophers sitting around a table. They are all thinking, eating, or waiting
  
When they **think** they *do not* hold any chopsticks. To **eat**, they need to *acquire the chopstick that is to their right **and** the chopstick that is to their left*. If they can *only get one of the chopsticks*, they **wait**.

- Naive implementations lead to deadlock

Concurrency
- No assumptions may be made about how long any process takes in the critical section (eating) or processing other tasks (thinking)

Safety
- Any two processes that are not logically adjacent can run its critical section simultaneously

Liveliness
- A process that is not running its critical section cannot prevent another process from it's critical section


#### Algorithm 1: pass directly
![center](../../zassets/Pasted%20image%2020231003145815.png)

- If everybody passes to the left, then everyone tries to take it from the right. This causes a circular block.

*TO SOLVE:*
Processes must relinquish resources if they can't execute their critical section.

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%;">This is a code snippet from lecture</div>

Note:
- Track all states
- getRight and getLeft, as well as takeBothHashi

Lets look at this algorithm:
- Main loop is infinite while
- Every process begins by thinking deeply
- if someone needs to eat, they attempt takeBothHashi
- if they can take both, they eat, and drop both hashi when done


## Producer Consumer
Concurrency
- Producers and consumers act in parallel
- Multiple producers and consumers should be able to read the buffer at one time
- No assumptions made about speed

Safety
- Never can two producers write to the same buffer entry at the same time
- Never can two consumers read from the same entry at the same time
- Never can a consumer read from an entry while a producer is writing to it

Liveness
- No process not currently writing to or reading from an entry may prevent another process from finding an entry
- No process must wait indefinitely to obtain access to an entry as long as entries are available

Correctness
- No entry shall be overwritten with a new item before the previous item is removed.
- No empty entry shall be read by a consumer.

Naive solutions to the P-C problem tend to end in fatal race conditions.
- This can lead to shared variables, double writes, or double reads

*What is the problem with the code above?*
- In the producer, checking if the buffer is full and blocking the process is *not* an atomic action. 
	- Therefore, a producer process may check and find a full buffer and be pre-empted
	- Then, the next process removes an item from the buffer, making it not full anymore
	- However, the producer will still be blocked because the wakeup signal is only sent when the buffer is full
*How do we fix this?*
- Critical sections!!!

![center](../../zassets/Pasted%20image%2020231004110654.png)

This implementation uses three semaphores:
- Empty
	- These control the items in the buffer
	- Empty starts with Max entries
- Full
	- These control the items in the buffer
	- Full starts with zero entries
- Critical
	- This controls access to the critical region, which has the operations to enqueue or dequeue from buffer
	- This is binary, can be one or zero

#### In the producer thread, 
when an item is produced, the Empty semaphore receives a *down*.
- When the down occurs, this means that there is a free slot available for the item being produced
- If it doesn't, the buffer is full and the process blocks.

*If the down occurs*, a down happens in the critical semaphore.
- This guarantees that only one process at a time enters the critical region
- If the down doesn't occur, the process blocks
- If the down does occur, the process accesses the region and adds an item to the queue

Critical then receives an up, meaning that the process is leaving the critical region

Full receives an up, meaning that an item has been added to the buffer

#### In the consumer,
we make sure that there is an item to be consumed by performing a *down* on full.

Then, the critical region is accessed, this time to dequeue.

Then, critical receives an up and so does empty.

*This solves the problem.*

*Until you bring in multiple read/writes...*

As you can see in the diagram, because only one buffer can read/write at a time, it becomes a waiting game. This is known as the *bottleneck.*

*How can we make this better?*

Instead of locking the whole buffer, lock individual entries.

![center](../../zassets/Pasted%20image%2020231004115206.png)


In this implementation, a new variable is created that receives which entry on the buffer is currently reserved. We will call this "entry."

After producing, the code requests an empty entry with getEmpty().
- This is a blocking operation

If an empty entry is found, the buffer entry is populated and declared full with alertFull().
