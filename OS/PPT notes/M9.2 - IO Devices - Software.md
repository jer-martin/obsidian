#### **Key Concepts**

- **I/O Devices from a Software Perspective**: Understanding the role of the operating system (OS) in managing I/O devices.
- **Character Printers**: Example of a simple I/O device with minimal buffering.

#### **Role of the Operating System**

- **System Calls**: Required for a user to perform I/O operations, ensuring system integrity and managed access to memory, storage, and I/O devices.
- **Kernel Mode**: Switch to kernel mode during system calls for security and control.

#### **I/O Operations**

1. **Programmed I/O with Polling**
    
    - The I/O device is continuously polled to determine readiness for read/write operations.
    - Involves busy waiting, where the CPU continuously checks the I/O device's status.
    - Example code of a print function demonstrated.
    - Downside: Busy waiting is a waste of CPU time.
2. **Programmed I/O with Interrupts**
    
    - Avoids busy waiting by using interrupts.
    - When the device is ready, it issues an interrupt to the CPU.
    - Demonstrated with a print function example, using interrupts to signal readiness.
    - More efficient than polling but still requires CPU to handle interrupt requests.
3. **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**
    
    - Allows I/O devices to directly access main memory without CPU intervention.
    - More efficient performance as it minimizes CPU involvement.
    - Example explained with a printing process using DMA.
    - DMA controller handles communication with the I/O device.

#### **Summarizing**

- Different methods of handling I/O operations have different impacts on CPU utilization and system performance.
- Programmed I/O with polling is simple but inefficient due to busy waiting.
- Programmed I/O with interrupts reduces busy waiting but still involves CPU for interrupt handling.
- DMA offers better performance by offloading work from the CPU to a dedicated controller.
