## The (Jovian) Gas Giants
- Fast rotators! Periods less than 18 hrs.
	*Why is this important?*
	- Strong Coriolis force → different weather patterns
	- Strong magnetic dynamo
- Jupiter and Saturn are larger because the protoplanetary disk was denser towards the center.

### Jovian Weather

#### Great Red Spot
- A big hurricane that has existed for over 300 years
- More rotation → more Coriolis-induced cells → more wind
	- Drives strong E-W motions
	- Earth's hurricanes are pitiful compared to Jupiter: 250 mph!
- Cooling and convection drive N-S circulation

- **Zones:
	- lighter, warmer, rising ammonia cloud tops
- **Belts**: 
	- darker, cooler, falling ammonium hydrosulfide

### Clouds of Uranus and Neptune
- Neptune had a Great Dark Spot (only lasted ~6 years)
- Uranus is duller due to increased mixing of gases.
	*Why?*
	- Seasons changing...


### The Internal Structures of the Gas Giants
- The planets are in hydrostatic equilibrium:
	- $\frac{dP}{dr}= \frac{-GM_{\rho}}{r^{2}}$ → $P_{c}= \frac{2\pi}{3}\rho^{2}GR^{2}$
- Jupiter has excess heat due to contraction.
- Saturn has excess heat from contraction *and* a possible He rainout.

### Magnetic Fields
- Magnetic field of Jupiter is largest and strongest
	- 20,000x stronger than Earth's
	*Why? What does magnetic field size and strength depend on?*
	- Amount of planet's metallic substances
		- Metallic hydrogen (Jupiter and Saturn only)
		- Core metals
		- Liquid water for Uranus and Neptune
	- Rotation rate
