## The (Jovian) Gas Giants
- Fast rotators! Periods less than 18 hrs.
	*Why is this important?*
	- Strong Coriolis force → different weather patterns
	- Strong magnetic dynamo
- Jupiter and Saturn are larger because the protoplanetary disk was denser towards the center.

### Jovian Weather

#### Great Red Spot
- A big hurricane that has existed for over 300 years
- More rotation → more Coriolis-induced cells → more wind
	- Drives strong E-W motions
	- Earth's hurricanes are pitiful compared to Jupiter: 250 mph!
- Cooling and convection drive N-S circulation

- **Zones:
	- lighter, warmer, rising ammonia cloud tops
- **Belts**: 
	- darker, cooler, falling ammonium hydrosulfide

### Clouds of Uranus and Neptune
- Neptune had a Great Dark Spot (only lasted ~6 years)
- Uranus is duller due to increased mixing of gases.
	*Why?*
	- Seasons changing...


### The Internal Structures of the Gas Giants
- The planets are in hydrostatic equilibrium:
	- $\frac{dP}{dr}= \frac{-GM_{\rho}}{r^{2}}$ → $P_{c}= \frac{2\pi}{3}\rho^{2}GR^{2}$
- Jupiter has excess heat due to contraction.
- Saturn has excess heat from contraction *and* a possible He rainout.

### Magnetic Fields
- Magnetic field of Jupiter is largest and strongest
	- 20,000x stronger than Earth's
	*Why? What does magnetic field size and strength depend on?*
	- Amount of planet's metallic substances
		- Metallic hydrogen (Jupiter and Saturn only)
		- Core metals
		- Liquid water for Uranus and Neptune
	- Rotation rate


### Moons
- Jupiter and Saturn > 60 each, many recently discovered
- The moons (larger than any dwarf planet) that we need to know:
	- Four Galilean Moons (Named after Jupiter's lovers):
		- Io
		- Europa
		- Ganymede
		- Callisto
	- Titan (Saturn, of the Titans)
	- Triton (Neptune)

### The Outer Planets - Mini Solar Systems

*How can Jupiter have such large moons?*
- More things can condense farther out
- This leads to runaway growth - extra condensable materials made the planets big enough to accrete hydrogen and helium
- Most moons formed in accretion disks (only some were captured)
	- Revolve in the same direction as the planet's rotation
	- Smallest probably captured debris

*How do the innermost moons rotate/revolve?*
- Synchronously like our Moon

#### Io (Jupiter)
##### The Most Volcanically Active Object in the Solar System
- No craters (very young surface)
- Io should have cooled by now ($R_{IO} \approx R_{moon}$)
	*Why is Io so volcanically active?*
	- Tidal forces from Jupiter

#### Europa
- Surface temp: -150$\textdegree$C
- Tidal force melts ice easier than rock
- Fractured, floating ice sheets
- Jupiter drives current in salty ocean, which drives Europa's magnetic field.

#### Ganymede
- Largest moon in the Solar System
- Has a measurable magnetic field; salty ocean?
- Heat?
	- Radioactive decay + tidal heating
	- Are they enough?

#### Callisto
- A heavily cratered ice-ball
- Never melted and differentiated
- Not a strong enough heat source

*There are 30 moons that orbit retrograde around Jupiter!*
