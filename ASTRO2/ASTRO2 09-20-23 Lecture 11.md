# Chapter 10.1 : The (Terrestrial) Planets

## Solar System Structure
[Continued from the end of this lecture...](ASTRO2%2009-18-23%20Lecture%2010.md)

- Uranus has a tilt of 97.7$\textdegree$
	- It has extreme seasons

#### Why is it warmer in the summer and colder in the winter (on Earth)?

1. Difference in direction of light
	- More sunlight on one area (more direct) = more heat
	- Less sunlight on area (less direct) = less heat 
		- Per surface area!

2. Hours of daylight
	- In the summer, there is more light time
		- This is why above or below a certain latitude the Sun will have extreme light timing

## Venus
- **Earth's Twin**
	- 0.95 $R_{⨁}$
	- 0.82 $M_⨁$ 
	- 0.72 AU Orbit
- **... the scary, desolate twin**
	- 735K uniform surface temperature
		- always overcast! no breeze!
		- tin, lead, and zinc *melt* at Venus surface temp
	- Clouds of sulfuric acid
	- Mostly $CO_{2}$ with *no* $H_{2}O$

#### Venus' Surface

- Only large craters
- Large planet → retains heat → volcanism

- Little tectonic activity
	- Too hot, no subduction zones

#### Runaway Greenhouse Effect
- If Earth moved to Venus' orbit, it would end up just like Venus
- Too hot due to distance from Sun
- No magnetic field (slow rotation)
	- Water evaporated and then UV destroyed water
	- Oxygen and hydrogen pushed out by solar winds
##### Why didn't the Earth suffer the same fate?
- There is ~170,000x as much $CO_{2}$ in rocks than in the atmosphere!

#### The Claimed Detection of Phosphine in Venus' Atmosphere
- $PH_{3}$ (phosphine) is only produced in rare situations
	- Extreme situations in gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn) leads to synthesis
	- Produced commonly by *LIFE*
- Maybe there is something living on Venus!
	- Turns out it wasn't, and it was just an error.

## Mars
- A cold, desolate, inhospitable place
- Pressure is 1% of Earths
- There is an atmosphere, but the density is so low the greenhouse effect is negligible
- Most Earth-like planet
	- 24.6 hr rotation
	- 25$\textdegree$ axis tilt (seasons)
	- Very convincing evidence for water and ice
- Smaller, less massive, colder
	- 0.53 $R_{⨁}$
	- 0.1 $M_{⨁}$
	- 223 K surface temp (-58$\textdegree$ F)
- Ice caps are made of both dry ice and water ice
-
