## Chapter 10.1 : The (Terrestrial) Planets

### Solar System Structure
[Continued from the end of this lecture...](ASTRO2%2009-18-23%20Lecture%2010.md)

- Uranus has a tilt of 97.7$\textdegree$
	- It has extreme seasons

#### Why is it warmer in the summer and colder in the winter (on Earth)?

1. Difference in direction of light
	- More sunlight on one area (more direct) = more heat
	- Less sunlight on area (less direct) = less heat 
		- Per surface area!

2. Hours of daylight
	- In the summer, there is more light time
		- This is why above or below a certain latitude the Sun will have extreme light timing

### Venus
- **Earth's Twin**
	- 0.95 $R_{⨁}$
	- 0.82 $M_⨁$ 
	- 0.72 AU Orbit
- **... the scary, desolate twin**
	- 735K uniform surface temperature
		- always overcast! no breeze!
		- tin, lead, and zinc *melt* at Venus surface temp
	- Clouds of sulfuric acid
	- Mostly $CO_{2}$ with *no* $H_{2}O$
	-
