## Atmospheres and the Formation of the Solar System

- ### Atmospheric Gas
     *Two key variables:*
    - particle speed (temperature)
        - measure of average kinetic energy of molecules
        - lower temp is slower, higher temp is faster
    - composition (mass)
        -  heavier things move slower than lighter things
    - #### exobase:
        - the base of the exosphere and the point at which a particle will escape before colliding with another particle
        - [height of the exobase](Chapter%208.3%20Notes.md)
    - #### Maxwell-Boltzmann Laws
        - $F(v)dv = 4\pi (\frac{m}{2\pi kT})^{\frac{3}{2}} v^{2}exp(\frac{-mv^{2}}{2kT})dv$ 
        - $v_{particle}=\sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}$ 
        - $v_{avg}=\sqrt{\frac{8kt}{\pi m}}$
        - $v_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{3kt}{m}}$ 
            - $v_{rms}$ is the root mean square of velocity
        - $v_{escape}= \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$ 
            - $v_{e}$ happens when kinetic energy ($v_{kin}= \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$) reaches the gravitational potential energy ($\frac{GMm}{r}$) 
    
    *By comparing the particle velocities to the escape velocity, we can see which particles stay and which escape*

## Where DId The Solar System Come From?
- ### Interstellar Medium
    - In addition to stars, the Milky Way also contains lots of gaseous matter between the stars
    - mostly carbon and silicon grains
        - sometimes with a coating of water ice, ammonia, or methane
    - typically in the order of 500 nm, similar to the wavelength of visible light
    
    *Dust absorbs light!*
    - bluer light is scattered more often than red
