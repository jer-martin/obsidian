- ### Nebula
	- An interstellar cloud of gas and dust
	- plural is nebulae

- ### Molecular clouds
	- Molecular clouds are the densest and coldest kind of interstellar clouds
	- If they get big enough, they collapse on themselves
		- this forms stars

	- ##### Summary of Cloud Collapse
		- Collisions excite molecules that then radiate away the energy
		- Temperature down means pressure down â†’ cloud can collapse
