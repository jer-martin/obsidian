## The Formation of the Solar System and Planetary Surfaces

- ### Where do stars come from?
	- Stellar nurseries, such as the "pillars of creation"

- ### Nebula
	- An interstellar cloud of gas and dust
	- plural is nebulae

- ### Molecular clouds
	- Molecular clouds are the densest and coldest kind of interstellar clouds
	- If they get big enough, they collapse on themselves
		- this forms stars

	- ##### Summary of Cloud Collapse
		- Collisions excite molecules that then radiate away the energy
		- Temperature down means pressure down → cloud can collapse
			- Potential energy → Kinetic energy
		- *Steps:*
			- The original cloud is large and diffuse, and it's rotation is imperceptibly slow. The cloud begins to collapse
			- Because of conservation of energy, the cloud heats up as it collapses. Because of conservation of angular momentum, the cloud spins faster as it contracts.
			- Collisions between particles flatten the cloud into a disk.
			- The result is a spinning, flattened disk with the center (and majority) of mass in the center of the disk.
			- A *protostar* forms in the center of the disk. This takes a few hundred thousand years.

- ### The Composition of the Sun and Planets (by mass)
	- Within the frost line, rocks and metals condense, whereas hydrogen compounds stay gaseous
	- Beyond the frost line, hydrogen compounds condense as well.
	- Within the solar nebula, 98% of the material is hydrogen and helium gas
		- These elements *cannot* condense anywhere

- ### Comets
	- Mostly ice, like the outer solar system
	- Originate as far out in the solar system as they can
	- Transported water to Earth in a process known as *heavy bombardment*
