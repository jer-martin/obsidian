### The Lorentz Transformation
- After Einstein: The Lorentz Transformation (for motion along x only)
$$x' = \gamma(x-vt),\ y'=y,\ z'=z,\ t'=\gamma(t-\frac{v}{c^2}x)$$
- The primed or A system - your speed is not relativistic compared to the frame of the emitted light beam
- The unprimed or B system - your speed is relativistic compared to the frame of the emitted light beam

- Notes about Lorentz:
	- Approaches the classical Galilean transformation as $\gamma = 1$

#### Consequences of Lorentz Transformation
- **Time dilation**- we already saw in the Lorentz factor derivation that time appears to be longer to the moving observer
$$\Delta t' =\gamma\Delta t > t$$
- **Length contraction** - length appears to be shorter for a moving observer *in the direction of motion*
$$L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}$$
### Relativistic Doppler Effect
$$\lambda_{A}=\frac{c}{f_{A}}=\frac{ct_{a}}{N}$$
- Blueshift case:
$$\lambda_{B} = \frac{ct_{B}-vt_{B}}{N}$$
