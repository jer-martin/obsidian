## The Habitable Zone
- Temperature is right for liquid water
- More massive stars shine brighter
	- They are hotter and more luminous, so their habitable zone is farther out

## Hot Jupiters
*They were the first type to be discovered. Why?*
- Large

- Nebular theory doesn't predict Hot Jupiters... *how did they get there?*
	- They must have migrated *after* formation
- **Viscous Torques**
	- The orbiting planet nudges gas and particles in the disk, causing material to bunch up. These dense regions then pull the planet inward.
- **Flyby Kicks**
	- Slingshotted into a more central orbit
