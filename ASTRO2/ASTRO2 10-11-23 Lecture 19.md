# Astronomy in Antiquity
- Not just alignment astronomy anymore
- Two new goals for astronomy
	- To predict celestial events (Babylonian - math)
	- To show that the motions of celestial bodies were regular (Greek)

## Astronomy in Ancient Egypt
- Most of our knowledge of Egyptian astronomy is from *The Book of Nut: Fundamentals of the Course of the Stars*

- Aligned with circumpolar stars
	- These stars are imperishable, they guide the spirit of the king

#### Finding the Meridian and True North - Shadow Plot
- Use a gnomon (vertical rod)
- Mark the end of the shadow from the Sun during the day
- Using a string, draw a circle that puts the arc of shadows in two places
- A line through those two points mark E-W and the meridian is perpendicular to this line and passes by the middle of it
