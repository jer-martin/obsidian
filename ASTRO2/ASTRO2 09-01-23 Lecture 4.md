## Properties of Light and the Composition of Atmospheres

#### Kirchoff's Laws
1. Continuous spectrum (e.g. blackbody)
2. Emission-line spectrum (e.g. glowing hot gas)
3. Absorption-line spectrum (e.g. cooler gas absorbing background continuum)

#### Why Our Simple Model Fails
- Planetary atmospheric/surface *absorption, emission, and reflection*
- Compare Neptune to Jupiter
    - They have similar blackbody spectrums, but are visually very different colors
    - They are both reflecting the Sun's blackbody spectrum
- Sun is *NOT* a perfect blackbody
    - Fraunhofer lines denote solar atmospheric absorption
- Atmospheric $CO_{2}$ 
    - Venus: 96%
    - Earth: 0.038%
- $L_{rad}= L_{rad}(\lambda)$, $L_{abs}= L_{abs}(\lambda)$ 
- $A = A(\lambda, t)$ 
    - clouds!
- internal heat
