## Moons! 
[Continued from last lecture...](ASTRO2%2009-25-23%20Lecture%2013.md)

### Titan (Saturn)
- The only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere
- Atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen with some argon, methane, and ethane
- Lakes!
	- Liquid methane and ethane
	- -180$\textdegree$ C (close to methane's triple point → all three phases)

### Triton (Neptune)
- Orbits backward (captured moon)
- Past volcanic/tectonic activity from tidal forces when first captured in an initially elliptical orbit?
- Will plunge in a few billion years and get shredded...

#### How could a moon be shredded?
- *Tidal disruption*
	- If the one object gets too close to another, the *differential* gravitational force can overcome the force holding the object together
- The limit at which this happens is called the *Rosche Limit*

### The Rings of the Outer Planets
*What do we observe?*
- Made of small particles of rock and ice

### Rings of Tiny Rock and Ice Chunks
*What defines the inner and outer radial boundaries?*
	→ Outer: the Roche limit
	→ Inner: atmospheric drag
