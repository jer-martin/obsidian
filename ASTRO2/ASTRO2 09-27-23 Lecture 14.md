## Moons! 
[Continued from last lecture...](ASTRO2%2009-25-23%20Lecture%2013.md)

### Titan (Saturn)
- The only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere
- Atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen with some argon, methane, and ethane
- Lakes!
	- Liquid methane and ethane
	- -180$\textdegree$ C (close to methane's triple point → all three phases)

### Triton (Neptune)
- Orbits backward (captured moon)
- Past volcanic/tectonic activity from tidal forces when first captured in an initially elliptical orbit?
- Will plunge in a few billion years and get shredded...

#### How could a moon be shredded?
- *Tidal disruption*
	- If the one object gets too close to another, the *differential* gravitational force can overcome the force holding the object together
- The limit at which this happens is called the *Roche Limit*

### The Rings of the Outer Planets
*What do we observe?*
- Made of small particles of rock and ice

### Rings of Tiny Rock and Ice Chunks
*What defines the inner and outer radial boundaries?*
	→ Outer: the Roche limit
	→ Inner: atmospheric drag
- Roche Limit
	- $d_{roche}=R_{P}(2 \frac{\rho P}{\rho_{s}})^\frac{1}{3}$
		- $R_{p} = \text{planet radius}$
		- $\rho_{p}= \text{planet density}$
		- $\rho_{s}=\text{satellite density}$
*The rings show gaps... why?*
	→ Resonances! *Caused by...*
	→ Moons!
- Largest: Saturn's Cassini division (2:1 resonance with Mimas)

### Where did the rings come from?
- Large moons are shredded...
	- Sometimes, but unlikely to happen in all cases
- Leftovers from formation of the solar system
	- No: particles get destroyed over time
- New particles are supplied from moons
	- Yes: impacts occur randomly all the time
	*Why are the rings different?*
	- Saturn: Albedo = 0.6; Uranus: Albedo = 0.05

### Condition for Sphericity
*For small bodies...*
- Can the compressional strength of the rock hold up against internal gravity?
	- Compressional strength, *S*, is given in Table 10.1
*Do we have an expression for the pressure we could use?*
- Approximate pressure:
	$P_{c}= \frac{2\pi}{3}\rho^{2}GR^{2}$
- $R = R_{sph}$ is the rough size at which an object becomes spherical:
	$\frac{2\pi}{3}\rho^{2}GR_{sph}^{2}\approx S$
- Solve for $R_{sph}$
	$R_{sph}\approx(\frac{3S}{2\pi G})^\frac{1}{2}$

### Asteroid Groups by Orbital Characteristics
- Aten
	- a <1 AU but aphelion outside Earth's orbit
- Apollo
	- a <1 AU but perihelion inside Earth's orbit
- Amor
	- outside Earth's orbit completely
