## Overview of the Solar System; Planetary Masses & Distances
- Mass (where in solar system?)
	- 99.8% of all the mass is in the Sun
- Orientation (structure / motion?)
	- Flattened disk
	- Revolution: all planets in the same direction
	- Rotation: most but not all in the same direction
- Age?
	- 4.6 Gyr (billion years)
- Naming/Designations
	- Planets, asteroids, dwarf planets, trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)

| Characteristic | Terrestrial |  Jovian |
| ----------- | ----------- |  -------|
| **Mass**| Low (< 1 Msun)| High (> 10 Msun) |  
| **Composition**| Rocky/metallic | Gaseous/icy 
| **Rotation**| Slow (P > 24 hr) | Fast (P < 18 hr) |  
| **Satellites**| Very few/none | Numerous |
| **Distance from Sun**| a < 2 AU | a > 2 AU |  


- What are the densities and compositions of the planets?
	- Jovian: $\rho$ ~ 700 - 2000 $kg m^-3$ 
		- Gas / ice (water, $CO_2$ , methane, ammonia)
		- Least dense is Saturn (710 $kgm^-3$), will float in water (1000 $kgm^-3$)
	- Terrestrial: $\rho$ ~ 3000-5500 $kgm^-3$ 
		- Rock / metal
	- Models for structure

- How do we know the mass of the planets...?
	- Orbital mechanics through Kepler's Laws
	- Eccentricity = $e = \frac{c}{a} = \sqrt{1-\frac{b^2}{a^2}}$  

	Perihelion
	- Closest distance to Sun
	Aphelion
	- Farthest distance from Sun

	$p_{yr}^2 = a_{au}^3$   
	- period (years) squared = aphelion (AU) cubed

	$p^{2} = \frac{4\pi^{2}}{(G(M_{1}+ M_2))}a^3$ 

	$F_{g}= \frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{d^2}$ 

	$M_{p} = \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{3}}{GP^2}$
