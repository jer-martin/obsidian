## Chapter 11: Small Bodies in the Solar System

### Looking for Planets Around Other Stars
- Nebular theory naturally predicts them
- First *exoplanet* discovered not until 1995
	- Nobel prize awarded in 2019

*Why might an exoplanet be hard to see?*
- Glare!
	From lecture 3:
	1. energy absorbed by the planet
		$L_{abs}=(\frac{L_{⊙}}{4\pi r^{2}})(\pi R^{2})(1 - A)$
	2. energy reflected
		$L_{ref}=(\frac{L_{⊙}}{4\pi R^{2}})(\pi R^{2})(A)$

*A basic test... could an observer at the nearest star detect Jupiter? (largest)*
- Maybe, but it would be difficult

*Why else would it be hard to detect an exoplanet?*
- Very small separation $(\theta)$
- Hard to resolve from host star

*Think about seeing two car headlights from far away (shows as one light), and as it gets closer the headlights "spread apart"*

- The wave nature of light fundamentally limits our ability to separate two objects
- *Rayleigh criterion* - two objects are *resolved* when the first minimum of one diffraction pattern coincides with the central maximum of the other

- How do we calculate $a$?
	→ $a = d \theta$
- But how do we measure $d$?
	→ Parallax

- $\theta = s / d$ ... we know $s$ (1 AU), and measure $\theta$, so we get $d$!

*But what about when parallax stops working?*
- We use background reference objects, because they don't move
	*A star with a parallax of 1 arcsec is at a distance of 1 parsec;* $d_{pc}=1/p_{arcsec}$
	- All parallactic angles are $p < 1$
	- 1 parsec = 3.26 ly

*How do we observe exoplanets?*
	→ Coronagraph
	*Just a mask...*

- In the easiest case, could an observer resolve Jupiter from Proxima / Alpha Centauri?
	- Diffraction limit - limit of telescopes outside the atmosphere
	- $\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$
		*This is a fundamental limitation - you cannot get around it*

- Limit of telescopes from the ground (atmospheric turbulence)
	- $\theta$ ~ $0.5$''
