## Chapter 11: Small Bodies in the Solar System

### The Poynting-Robertson Effect
- An orbiting body is moving into the "photon rain" (aberration of light)
- Photons carry momentum
	$p = E/c$
- Orbiting body decelerates and spirals into the Sun on the Poynting-Robertson timescale

$$t_{pr}\approx 0.7 \text{ Gyr }(\frac{\alpha}{1\text{ AU}})^{2} (\frac{\rho}{1000 \text{ kg m}^{-3}})(\frac{R}{1 \text{ m}})$$
### Tunguska Event of 1908
An explosion over the Stony Tunguska river in Siberia...*what was the cause?*
- A stony meteor with $d =$ 164-262 feet exploded with 500 kilotons (~25 Hiroshimas) 6-9 miles above the surface going 34,000 mph (15 km/s)


### The K-T Event
- In 1978, Luis and Walter Alvarez found a dark layer (~1 in.) all around the world
- Features of the layer
	- Rich in iridium, osmium, gold, platinum
	- Grains of shocked quartz (high pressure/temperature quartz crystals)
	- Spherical rock droplets (molten rock cooled and rained)
	- Soot (widespread forest fires)
*What is this?*
The massive event that killed the dinosaurs.
- City sized (~10 km) asteroid made a 180 km wide crater
- ~100 million Tsar Bomba (each 50 megatons)

#### The Effects of the Collision
- A shower of hot debris in North American killed most life instantly, ignited wide-spread forest fires
- A tsunami ~4 km high went ~1000 km inland
- Earthquakes of magnitude 13 on Richter scale
- Dust/smoke clouding the skies for weeks or months
	- Stopped photosynthesis
	- Initial global cooling
- Possible global warming after (released carbon)
- Harsh compounds and acid rain

*Small mammals survived!*
