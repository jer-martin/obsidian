## Chapter 11: Small Bodies in the Solar System

### The Poynting-Robertson Effect
- An orbiting body is moving into the "photon rain" (aberration of light)
- Photons carry momentum
	$p = E/c$
- Orbiting body decelerates and spirals into the Sun on the Poynting-Robertson timescale

$$t_{pr}\approx 0.7 \text{ Gyr }(\frac{\alpha}{1\text{ AU}})^{2} (\frac{\rho}{1000 \text{ kg m}^{-3}})(\frac{R}{1 \text{ m}})$$
### Tunguska Event of 1908
An explosion over the Stony Tunguska river in Siberia...*what *
