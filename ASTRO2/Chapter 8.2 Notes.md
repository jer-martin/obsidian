The masses of planets are measured by how they affect other objects near them. This is difficult for planets with no satellites (Mercury, Venus). We originally used the perturbations on other orbits, but since then we have sent probes which have been affected by gravity.

$M_{planet} \approx \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{3}}{GP^{2}}$ 
- $a$ is semimajor axis (usually in AU)
- $P$ is periods (usually in years)

Radius $R$ of a planet is computed from measured angular radius and it's distance. Therefore,

$\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^{3}}$
- $M$ is mass
- $R$ is radius

Densities of $\rho$ ~ 700 - 2000 $kg m^{-3}$ are typical of Jovian planets
- indicating composition that is gas and ice

Densities of $\rho$ ~ 3000 - 5500 $kgm^{-3}$ are typical of terrestrial planets
- indicating composition that is rock and metal

Surface temperature is dictated by a few factors:
- distance from Sun
- albedo (reflectivity)
	- albedo is a function of wavelength
- internal heat sources
- atmosphere
	- Earth and Venus are both warmer than equations expect due to the **greenhouse effect

The Sun is a blackbody, who's luminosity is:

$L_{⊙} = 4\pi R_{⊙}^{2} \sigma_{SB} T_{⊙}^{4}$ 
- $T_{⊙} \approx$ 5800 K
- This can be generalized past just the Sun

The Sun's radiation, expressed in terms of wavelength, peaks in the visible spectrum. This is why we can see sunlight.

Flux of energy received by a planet at a distance $r$ from the sun is:

$F(r)=\frac{L_{⊙}}{4\pi r^2}$ 

The energy that the planet *absorbs* per second is the flux $F$ times the cross section of the planet ($\pi R^2$) times 1 minus albedo. This is known as Wein's Law.

$W_{p}= (\frac{L_{⊙}}{4\pi r^2})(\pi R^{2})(1 - A)$ 

Molecules travel through the medium.. their mean free path is said to be around 400 angstroms at sea level. However, there is a point (called the [[ASTRO2 09-06-23 Lecture 5|exobase]]) where the mean free path increases to the point where a gas particle moving upward faster than the escape speed is able to escape from the atmosphere before colliding with another particle.

The height of the exobase is given by the relation:

$\int_{z_{ex}}^{\infty} \sigma n (z) \,dz = \sigma N (z_{ex)}= 1$ 

Where $N(z_{ex})$ is the column density of gas particles above the exobase.
