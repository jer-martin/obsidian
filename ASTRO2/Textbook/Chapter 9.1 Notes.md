## The Earth's Interior
- ### Makeup
    - **Core**
        - primarily iron and nickel
        - contributes ~16% of volume
        - contributes ~31% of mass
        - **Inner Core**
            - radius ~1300 km
            - solid
        - **Outer Core**
            - radius ~2200 km
            - liquid
    - **Mantle**
        - radius ~2900 km
        - liquid, but chunky
    - **Crust**
        - radius ~30 km
        - solid
        - primarily rocks made out of lighter elements (silicon, aluminum) rather than heavier elements (iron)
    *The deepest holes humanity has dug only reach about 12 km*
- ### Seismic Waves
    - the most fruitful method for inferring properties of the mantle and core
    - a disturbance, generally caused by an earthquake, that travels through the Earth's interior
    - ### P-Waves
        - pressure waves
        - compressional
            - regions of high and low pressure travelling through the earth
        - faster than S-wave
        - not detected between 103$\textdegree$ and 142$\textdegree$ of the epicenter
    *In short, a P-wave is a sound wave*
    - ### S-Wave
        - shear wave
        - transverse
            - individual particles move back and forth perpendicular to the direction of propagaton
        - slower than P-wave
        - only detected within 103$\textdegree$ of the epicenter
            - this is due to the fact that they cannot travel through the outer core
    *In short, an S-wave is analogous to a workout rope*
