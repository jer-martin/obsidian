## Properties of Light and Planetary Temperatures

### Surface Temperatures
- What is the origin of (most of) the heat energy?
	- Sunlight
- How do we describe this "light" energy?
	- Electromagnetic radiation
	- Waves AND Particles (but mostly waves)
	- 
- Why is it colder further from the Sun?
- #### Luminosity
	- $L = \frac{E}{t} = Watts$  
- #### Brightness (Flux)
	- $B = F = \frac{E}{\frac{t}{A}} = \frac{L}{4\pi r^{2}}= \frac{Watts}{m^2}$
