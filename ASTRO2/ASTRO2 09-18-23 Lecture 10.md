### Properties of the Moon and Earth's Atmosphere

#### The Coriolis Effect
- Rotation causes objects to appear to divert paths depending on your relative motion
##### Not Important For *(Local Forces Win)*:
- Toilets / Drains
- Tornadoes / Dust devils
##### Important For:
- Large pressure systems (hurricanes)
- Firing a missle

#### Large-Scale Weather Patterns
- The Coriolis effect makes moving air deviate to its right in the Northern hemisphere
	- Opposite in Southern
- Coriolis effect denotes *Hadley cells*, which are "storm containers"

### Atmospheres Affect Light
- *Why are green laser pointers brighter than red ones?*
	- Our eyes are more sensitive to green light than red light (adapted to Sun)
	- Green light is *scattered* by our atmosphere more strongly than red light

- For the molecules in the air and visible light (L << $\lambda$), Rayleigh scattering is important:
	- $\sigma$ ∝ $cos^{2}(\Theta) * \lambda^{-4}$
		- where $\sigma$ is the scattering cross section
	- Strong dependencies on *angle* and *wavelength*
		- Angle of the sun matters
		- Blue light is scattered strongest

### The Moon - Lunar Features
- Highlands
	- Lighter colored and older
- Maria ("seas of ancient lava")
	- Darker colored and younger

- *How do we know the ages?*
	1. Amount of cratering
	2. Radiometric dating

#### Radiometric Dating
- Measure the amount of an isotope that decays and spontaneously
