### Properties of the Moon and Earth's Atmosphere



![center](../zassets/Pasted%20image%2020230918115258.png)

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%;font-style: italic;">Prevailing westerlies and trade winds separate the Hadley cells due to the Coriolis effect</div> 

### Atmospheres Affect Light
- *Why are green laser pointers brighter than red ones?*
	- Our eyes are more sensitive to green light than red light (adapted to Sun)
	- Green light is *scattered* by our atmosphere more strongly than red light

- For the molecules in the air and visible light (L << $\lambda$), Rayleigh scattering is important:
	- $\sigma$ ∝ $cos^{2}(\Theta) * \lambda^{-4}$
		- where $\sigma$ is the scattering cross section
	- Strong dependencies on *angle* and *wavelength*
		- Angle of the sun matters
		- Blue light is scattered strongest

### The Moon - Lunar Features
- Highlands
	- Lighter colored and older
- Maria ("seas of ancient lava")
	- Darker colored and younger

- *How do we know the ages?*
	1. Amount of cratering
	2. Radiometric dating

#### Radiometric Dating
- Measure the amount of an isotope that decays spontaneously and predictably over time
- Useful for figuring out:
	- the age of human remains and tools
	- the age of the dinosaurs and when they went extinct
	- the age of the solar system

- Heavy nuclei are not stable and spontaneously decay at various rates
	- Example:
		${}^{235}_{92} \text{U} → {}^{231}_{90} \text{Th} + {}^{4}_{2}\text{He}$

- ### What are the variables that affect the planets the most?

## Solar System Structure
- All revolve in the same direction, CCW from North
- Planets and Sun rotate in same direction, counter-clockwise from North
	- except Venus and Uranus (collisions)


## The Moon and Mercury
### Geology and Size
- No atmosphere
- High surface temperature
	- Low escape velocity
	- Drastic temperature changes
- Smallest means interiors cooled fastest
- Heavily cratered, 3-4 billion years old

### Craters and Scarps
