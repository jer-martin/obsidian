# Machine Learning and Astronomy

- We will be introduced to various ML tools/techniques which we can implement to solve Astrophysical problems
	- We will talk about theory behind each ML technique. Without understanding how it works, ML will remain as a black box.
	- We will be given Jupyter notebooks with examples so that we can learn to use ML techniques in practice.

# What is Machine Learning?

- Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn _without being explicitly programmed_
- Instead of manually making rules, we provide a number of examples and apply [[ALGO 08-24-23 Lecture 1|algorithms]] so that the computer builds a model to make predictions or decisions
- Model prediction is only as good as the training dataset

## Branches of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
	- Give the machine answers
- Unsupervised Learning
	- Clustering (finding patterns)
	- Anomaly/novelty detection
	- Dimensionality Reduction
- Semi-supervised Learning
	- We can propagate labels using clustering algorithms
