# Machine Learning and Astronomy

- We will be introduced to various ML tools/techniques which we can implement to solve Astrophysical problems
	- We will talk about theory behind each ML technique. Without understanding how it works, ML will remain as a black box.
	- We will be given Jupyter notebooks with examples so that we can learn to use ML techniques in practice.
