## Packets V.S. Circuit
*packet switching allows more users to use the network!*
### Example:
- 1 Gb/s link
- each user:
    - 100 Mb/s when active
    - active 10% of the time
- #### How many users can the network support?
    - **circuit switching**
        - 10 users
    - **packet switching**
        - with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time is less than .0004 *

- #### How did we get value .0004?
	- 
- #### What happens if > 35 users?
