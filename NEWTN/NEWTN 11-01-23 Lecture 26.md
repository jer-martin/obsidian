### Abu Rayham Biruni (973-1048)

- Resided in Toledo and Seville in Spain

#### Toledo Tables
- Based on al-Battani as well as Ptolemy. Corrected errors from Ptolemy's work
- Original Arabic table lost, but Latin translations survived
- Tables adapted all over Europe

#### Trepidation of the Equinoxes (not correct)
- Ptolemy had confirmed the precession rate to be ~1 degree per 100 years
- Comparing new star positions to those of Ptolemy showed a rate of ~1 degree per 65 years (if they had used Hipparchus, it wouldve been 72 years - this would be correct)
- Concluded that precession rate increasing while declination was decreasing
- Proposed adding an additional sphere above the one with stars and that the combination of the motions of this sphere and the star sphere creates the trepidation

#### Instruments
Invented two new instruments: 
#####  Saphea Arzachelis
latitude independent or *universal* astrolabe)
##### Equatorium
- Used to convert a planet's position to its actual positon â†’ focuses on planets
- Worked like analog computer, replacing hand calculations using tables

#### Alphonsine Tables
- Sponsored by King Alfonso X ("Wise") of Leon and Castile to correct anomalies in Toledo Tables
