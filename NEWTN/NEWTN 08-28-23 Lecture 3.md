## The Sky and the Celestial Sphere

### Observer's Sky
- Dome of infinite radius over observer's head
- Specific to a particular location on Earth at a particular instant in time

- ##### zenith
	- point directly overhead
- ##### nadir
	- point directly underfoot
- ##### ideal horizon
	- halfway between zenith and nadir (on a perfectly flat Earth)
- ##### celestial meridian
	- line joining zenith with North and South
- ##### azimuth
	- 0$\textdegree$ to 360$\textdegree$ from North
	- Measured from North to East
	- N E S W
- ##### altitude
	- 0$\textdegree$ to 90$\textdegree$ from horizon

### Apparent Motion of Stars
- Depending on location, we see some stars rising on the east and setting on the west
	- In other locations, some stars never set. This is known as **circumpolar**
- For someone on the equator, all stars rise and set
- Polaris is at 90$\textdegree$ at the North Pole
- Polaris is ~30$\textdegree$ (closer to 29$\textdegree$) at Gainesville
- Polaris is 0$\textdegree$ at Equator

### Measuring the Sky
- We measure the sky in angles, not distances
	- Pinkie = 1$\textdegree$
	- Three middle fingers = 5$\textdegree$ 
	- Fist = 10$\textdegree$  

### Earth Coordinate System
- ##### Latitude
	- N-S of the Equator
	- Equator is 0$\textdegree$
	- Altitude of Polaris = Observer latitude
- ##### Longitude
	- E-W of the Prime Meridian
	- PM is 0$\textdegree$ 

- ##### International Time Line
	- 180$\textdegree$ from PM
	- Add a day going west, subtract a day going east

## Four Fundamental Propositions of Greek Astronomy
### 1. The Earth is a sphere
- What observations can you make to determine the shape of the Earth?
	- Aristotle noticed the Earth's shadow is curved during a lunar eclipse
	- Travelers reported that height of the Pole star above horizon varies as you travel North to South
### 2. The Earth doesn't move
- Why would they think that the Earth doesn't move?
	- We do not feel the Earth moving
	- Objects thrown upward drop back to point of departure
	- If Earth moved about the Sun, then we should observe **stellar parallax**
