### Regiomontanus
- Published Ephemerides for years 1475-1506
- Famously used by Columbus in 1504 in his fourth and final voyage to America to trick natives in Jamaica to give him provisions
- Regiomontanus predicted there would be a total lunar eclipse on the evening of February 29, 1504

### Nicolaus of Cusa (1401-1464)
- Southern Germany
- Cardinal in the Catholic Church
- "Of Learned Ignorance"
- First modern idea of infinite
- Human mind can never obtain a precise portrait of reality since it only knows by relation, inquiry is comparative
- Non-uniform motion (only God is always the same, everything else must change)
- "The Earth, which cannot be the center, cannot be devoid of motion. Instead it is even necessary that the Earth be moved"

# Chapter 4: Copernican Revolution

### Intellectual Climate 
**Fall of Constantinople**
- Largest, most powerful city for over 1000 years
- Major center of trade
- Fell to Ottoman Turks
**Renaissance**
- Rebirth of cultural activity in Europe
- Revival of Greek culture
**Reformation**
- Martin Luther (1483-1546) - Germany
	- Salvation as a gift of God's grace, possible through faith
	- Church is corrupt
	- Excommunicated
	- Beginning of Protestant Reformation

## Copernicus (1473-1543)
- Born Niklas Koppernigk in Thorn
- Mother from important family
- Nicolaus and older brother Andreas taken under care of maternal uncle, later Bishop of Warmia - political *and* spiritual authority
- Entered University of Cracow at 18
- Studied astronomy (Peurbach's New Theory of the Planets and Aristotle's On the Heavens among others)
- Uncle talked him into a career in the Church to allow him to live comfortably while partaking in a life of study
- University of Bologna (degree in canon law), also studied math, astronomy, Greek
- In 1497 he received the appointment as canon, with it's salary
- Took a year off in Rome and lectured on math and astronomy. Asked permission to go back to the university to study medicine - Church pays for it
- University of Padua was famous for medicine and astronomy
- Received doctorate in Canon law from Ferrara University
- Returned to Padua, no record of graduation
- Returned to Poland and took position as canon at Frauenberg (Frombork) cathedral (age 37)

### Seven Theses
1. Celestial bodies do not all revolve around the same point
2. Earth's center is only the center of the Moon's orbit and the center of gravity
3. All planets revolve around the Sun, which is the center of the universe
4. The Earth-Sun distance is extremely small compared to the distance of the stars → no parallax
5. The stars are immobile; their change in position is due to Earth's movement
6. Earth revolves around the Sun, causing the Sun's motion around the ecliptic, in addition to other motions
7. Earth's revolution around the Sun causes retrograde motion

### War in Warmia (1519-1521)
- Poland vs the Teutonic Knights
- Copernicus involved in organizing and coordinating the defense of the town (Olsztyn)

### New Theories
- 1530 first handwritten draft of De Revolutionibus
- Pope Clement VII requested to be briefed on new Copernican theory in 1533
- 1539 visit by Rheticus, professor of astronomy and mathematics at Wittenberg University

### De Revolutionibus (1543)
- Six books
- Heliocentric model
- Dedicated to Pope Paul III
- Printed in Nuremberg (Rheticus first, then Andreas Osiander)
- Osiander made two unauthorized changes, probably with the best of intentions
	- Title changed to On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, Six Books
		→ suggesting Earth excluded
	- Preface added without Osiander's name attached
		→ preface contradicts heliocentricity!
		- Introduced without consultation from Copernicus or Rheticus
		- Admitted contents controversial
		- Denied models were real

*Why did he make these changes?*
→ He was afraid of the Protestants!
*He was right too...*
→ Martin Luther called Copernicus "that fool who would overturn all of astronomy"

*Why were the Protestants opposed?*
- They believed that each man could and should interpret the Bible for himself
- There are passages that show the sun moving, opposing Copernicism

*Why was the Roman Catholic Church not opposed?*
- the bishops and cardinals thought Copernicus' work was interesting
- Church officials saw no threat to Church doctrine; interpretation of the Bible was in the hands of Church theologians
- Copernicus was one of their own!

1. Outline of Copernican system and arguments for it, plus two chapters on planes and spherical triangles
2. Spherical astronomy
3. Earth's motions
4. Moon's motions
5. Planetary motions in (celestial) longitude
6. Planetary motions in (celestial) latitude

### Arguments for Copernican System
1. Citations from ancients - Philolaus, Heraclides, and others, but *not* Aristarchus; also, idea of Sun as "hearth of the Universe"
2. Criticisms of Ptolemy - equant, celestial sphere rotating more rapidly than Earth; also Sun's role

## Book 1
- Sun-centered
- Earth is a planet (3rd from the Sun)
- Earth motions:
	- Daily rotation
	- Annual revolution around the Sun
- Daily rotation of celestial sphere due to Earth rotation
- Yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic due to Earth orbit

*Parallax still a problem!*
