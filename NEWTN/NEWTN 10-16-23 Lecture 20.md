## Egyptian Calendar
- Year divided into three seasons of 4 months each:
	- Flood
	- Emergence (low water)
	- Harvest
- Rising of the Nile doesn't fall on an exact day, but over a few days.
- It was discovered that the Nile floods at Memphis coincide with Sirius (Sothis, identified with Isis) heliacal rising in mid-summer.
- Other months from lunar festivals
- Sun only used to mark the year
- Other stars' or groups heliacal risings make the rest of the calendar

### Lunisolar Calendar
- Intercolation
	- insert 13th month named Thoth, only if Sirius heliacal rising were to fall in month 12 to align the calendar with the event
- Eventually the length was set at 365 days, months were 30 days, weeks at 10 days
- Very simple and practical, Copernicus used this calendar for astronomical tables

#### Decans
- Years had 36 weeks
- The heliacal rising of 36 stars (or constellations) marked the beginning of each week (Sothis the main star) → Decans
- Decans (10) also divided night by transit of meridian
- Not all nights had the same number of Decans - about 12 per night
- Applied to daytime by analogy → 24 hours of day, still used today

#### 24 Hour Day
- Upper half southern sky
- Narrow columns are the decans, named after each star or group
- Also gods and planets
- Lower half is northern

- XV BC decanal stars were considered a poor way to mark time and regulate religious and civil life
- They had a priest sit and track manually

### Egyptian Zodiac
- Divided ecliptic into 12 parts
- *Not* evenly divided
- Dates differ from usual zodiac
	- 25-29 instead of 21 → different zero points
- Cancer → scarab (Ra)
- Gemini → Horus (god of the Sky, son of Osiris)
- Leo → Sphynx
- Orion → Osirus

## Egyptian Theoretical Astronomy
- Clear skies much of the time - similar to Babylon
- Great technological ability (ex. Pyramids)
**Never developed theoretical astronomy.**
*Why?*
- Cumbersome math:
	- No place values
	- Fractions can only have 1 in numerator (1/2, 1/4, etc)

## Astronomy In Antiquity Greece
### Thales of Miletus (625 - 547 BC)
- Founded Milesian school of natural philosophy
- Developed the scientific method
- First known to consider cosmos as understandable through reason, free from divine intervention (first natural philosopher)
- Believed universe ultimately consists of one element - water
- Original thinker the idea of water similar to Greek mythological gods
- Water can spontaneously change → life
#### About Earth
- Reputation of having predicted solar eclipse 585 BC
- Eclipse did occur, but it was impossible to predict solar eclipses given the observations they had
- Many other ideas attributed to h
