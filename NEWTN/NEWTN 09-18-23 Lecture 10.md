## Nodes and Lunar Standstills
#### Node:
- The crossing point of the ecliptic and the orbital path of the moon

#### Apparent Motions of the Moon
- Moon's rising, setting and altitude in the sky changes similar to the Sun's
- The rising Sun moves north and south of east during the year
- The rising moon moves north and south of east over the course of a month

*However, the Moon's orbit is tilted 5$\textdegree$ relative to the ecliptic*
- Therefore, the Sun and the Moon don't really match, and cross twice a month (*ascending and descending nodes*)

##### *NODES OF THE MOON DO NOT STAY FIXED*
- They drift westward along the ecliptic
- Takes 18.6 years to complete one circuit

- When the ascending node is at the [vernal equinox](NEWTN%2009-01-23%20Lecture%204.md) (0 hr) → Moon is at maximum angular position

### Major Standstills
- Ascending node at vernal equinox → tilt of the Moon's path *added* from obliquity

### Minor Standstills
- Descending node at vernal equinox → tilt of the Moon's path *subtracted* from obliquity

### Lunar Standstills
- *Major standstills* are the ones that are farthest from east (for moonrise) or west (moonset)
	- Moon highest altitude
- *Minor standstills* are the ones closest to east and west
	- Moon lowest altitude

	*THERE IS RANGE IN BETWEEN - THESE ARE THE EXTREMES*

- Moon rises over 14 day period, the second half of this cycle will reverse the sequence to the beginning during standstill
- Standstills depend on where the ascending node is relative to the vernal equinox

- Moon's orbit tilted 5$\textdegree$ to ecliptic plane
	- Crosses ecliptic plane *only at the two nodes*
	- Eclipse possible only when full/new occur near nodes
