## Nodes and Lunar Standstills
#### 

#### Apparent Motions of the Moon
- Moon's rising, setting and altitude in the sky changes similar to the Sun's
- The rising Sun moves north and south of east during the year
- The rising moon moves north and south of east over the course of a month

*However, the Moon's orbit is tilted 5$\textdegree$ relative to the ecliptic*
- Therefore, the Sun and the Moon don't really match, and cross twice a month (*ascending and descending nodes*)

##### *NODES OF THE MOON DO NOT STAY FIXED*
- They drift westward along the ecliptic
- Takes 18.6 years to complete one circuit
