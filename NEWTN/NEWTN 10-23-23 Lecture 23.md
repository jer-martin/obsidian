### Eratosthenes (276-195 BC)
- Director of Museum at Alexandria (and the Library)
- Mathematician - developed method for finding prime numbers
- Estimated Earth's circumference based on observations of the Sun at different latitudes on summer solstice

### Hipparchus (190-120 BC)
- Possibly greatest astronomer before Ptolemy
- He wrote books on optics, arithmetic, an astronomical calendar, geographical and astrological writings and a work entitled "On Objects Carried Down by their Weight"
- Just one work survived
- Library at Alexandria burned
- Greeks tended to discard books that were superseded
- Ptolemy refers to him in his work
- First to insist that a geometrical planetary theory **had to work in detail**
	- They had to agree with observation *and* make accurate predictions

#### Solar Orbit
- Seasons of are different lengths
	→ Use *eccentric* - move Earth from center of circle

#### Lunar Orbit
- Used Babylonian list of lunar eclipses which gives detailed information on the time of eclipses
- From the time, he derived the position of the Sun
- From the position of the Sun, place the Moon 180 degrees away (required for lunar eclipses)
- Tried both eccentric and epicycle to model Moon's motion → only worked for full moon. Too complicated!

#### Lost Star Catalogue
- Positions in equatorial coordinates, given as celestial latitude and longitude, not RA and declination
- Comparison of his positions with those of Timocharis and Aristllos from a century earlier led to discovery of procession of equinoxes
- Vernal equinox defines the celestial frame of reference
- Apparent brightness assigned to categories called *magnitudes*, became basis of magnitude system used today

##### Magnitude System
- Hipparchus placed the brightest stars in the first magnitude and the faintest in the sixth
- Scale is logarithmic or geometric, like Richter scale
	- A change of 5 in magnitude is a change of 100 in brightness

### Ptolemy → Claudius Ptolemaeus
- Resided in Alexandria as Roman citizen, but Greek origin
- Was also an astrologer - hence his interest in the motions of the planets
- Greatest work was *Matematike syntaxis (Mathematical Compilation)* in 13 volumes
	- Also known as the Megiste (greatest) syntaxis, al-Majisti, Almagestum, Almagest
