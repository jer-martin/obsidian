# Mayan Calendar

- The *haab* or "Vague Year"
	- 1 day = 1 kin
	- 1 uinal = 20 kin
	- 1 tun = 18 uinal = 360 kin
	- plus the Uayeb (5 unnamed days) for a total of 365

*Why 260?*
- Venus' period of visibility as morning / evening star is around 260 days
- Synodic period of Mars = 780 days (3 * 260 ?)
- Human gestation period ~ 270 days?

*We don't know.*

- 52 year calendar round
	- Both 365 and 260 calendars run simultaneously
	- Every day has a *haab* and *tzolk*
