### Project Overview
We will need to submit following info online
- Name of instrument
- List of materials (the device needs to collect data without paper)
- Data you will collect with the instrument
- References
*THIS CAN BE VERY SHORT*

### Sundials
- Track the motion of the sun
- Tell time
- Track seasons
- Determine true north
- Determine summer and winter solstices

### Cross Staff
- Long staff and four shorter sliding cross pieces of different lengths
	- only one piece at a time
- Measure altitude of objects, measure angles between objects

### Back Staff
- More accurate than cross staff

### Sextant
- More accurate than cross-staff and back staff.
- Still in use today!

### Telescopic Quadrant
- Used for measuring altitude along meridian
- Angular scale from 0$\textdegree$  to top of slab to 90$\textdegree$ at bottom
- "Quadrant" refers to quarter-circle

### Armillary Sphere
- One of the oldest astronomical instrument
- Used both as a demonstration instrument and for observing
- Closely related to celestial sphere

### Astrolabe
- Dual purpose (like armillary) demonstration, observation, navigation, converting between time-keeping systems, calculating trigonometric functions
- Two disks, one representing observer and the other the celestial sphere projected onto the plane of the equator (movable)
