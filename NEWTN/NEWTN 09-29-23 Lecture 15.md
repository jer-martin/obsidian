- A complete revolution of a planet on its orbit relative to a star is the *sidereal period*
	→ Venus' is 225 days
	→ Earth's is 365.25 days

- Interval between successive occurrences of given configuration relative to the Sun (including heliacal rising) is *synodic period*
	→ Venus - 584 days before the same configuration is repeated
		- Important for Mayan calendar

- Transit is possible during inferior conjunction

- Venus is Morning Star at greatest Western elongation

- Superior planets elongation can be as much as 180$\textdegree$ during quadrature
