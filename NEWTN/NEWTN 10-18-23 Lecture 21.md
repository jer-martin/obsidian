### Plato (more under Aristotle later)
- Plato's Timaeus
	- Describe the universe using Platonic solids → mathematical descriptions of the universe (the five regular polyhedrons were known before Plato)
	- All faces are congruent regular polygons → all angles equal

- Pyramid - smallest volume for surface area → dryness → Fire
- Octahedron - not stable on any corner → most movable, rotates freely → Air
- Cube - stable on all sides → least movable → Earth
- Icosahedron - largest volume for surface area → wetness → Water
- Dodecahedron → the Universe
