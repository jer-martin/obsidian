## Aristotle
- Eudoxus's theoretical spheres became physical
- Spheres were physically connected, starting with outermost sphere of fixed stars
- Daily motions of Sun, Moon, and planets driven by outermost sphere → eliminate individual daily motion spheres
- Necessary to introduce "cancelling spheres" to keep outer planet's motions from being transferred to it's neighbor
- Ended up with *55 spheres!!!!!!*

- Earth is spherical; presented four arguments - one theoretical and the rest observational
	- Can only see mast of ship on horizon, see hull when closer
	- Altitude of Pole Star changes as one travels N or S
	- He observed that the Earth's shadow is curved during a lunar eclipse
	- Tendency of elements earth and water to sink → compressed towards center will make a sphere

- Earth does not rotate around an axis
	- He believed that an arrow shot vertically would land to the west of the archer
		*This does happen, but it's minuscule*

### Stellar Parallax
- Apparent shift in the position of the stars because of the motion of the observer
- The farther the object, the smaller the parallax
- The larger the baseline of the moving object, the larger the parallax observed
	→ parallax from stars are not observable, they're too far away

**ARISTOTLES IDEAS WERE CONSIDERED AUTHORITATIVE UNTIL THE 17th CENTURY**
