## Astronomy Before History

### Prehistoric Europe
#### Megalithic Sites
- *Megalith*
	- from greek for "large stone"
- First attempt to build complex structure
- Scattered throughout British Isles and Brittany in France

*This marked the transition between the Paleolithic to Neolithic eras (hunter-gatherer â†’ settlements)*

#### John Aubrey
- "Monumenta Britannica" manuscript of field work at Avebury, Stonehenge, and notes to many other ancient sites. Never published.
- Showed a drawing with 56 holes, depressions on the earthwork, later excavated and rediscovered in the 1920s and named after Aubrey
- Proposed that Stonehenge was a temple built by the Druids, priests of pagan Celts

#### William Stukeley
- "Stonehenge, a temple restor'd to the British Druids" - 1740
- Multiple drawings of the monument from different angles
- Name the "doorway" a trilithon (three rocks making a door) - still used today
- Dated the site to 460 BC
	- assuming builders knew about magnetic north and periodic oscillations of the magnetic north. this is wrong!
- Also attributed Stonehenge to the Druids
- Realized the Sun's alignment with Stonehenge

#### Gerald Hawkins
- Professor and chair of the astronomy department at Boston University
- First astronomer to use a digital computer to analyze Stonehenge
	- Calculated azimuths of lines through each pair of stones
	- Compared those with azimuths of Sun, Moon, planets, and stars looking for matches
		- Comparison allowed small tolerqances
		- All principle alignments seem to point towards the extreme positions on the horizon of the rising and setting of either the Sun or the full Moon
- Hugely popular *and controversial*
- Praised by some, attacked by others
- Hugely arrogant and extremely biased
