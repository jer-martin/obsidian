## The Almagest
- Books 1 and 2 - Mathematics (trig), observations of length of year, equinoxes
- Book 3 - Motion of the Sun (used Hipparchus work)
- Books 4 - Moon (Hipparchus, proved that H. model and observations do not agree well, but H had already done that)
- Book 5 - New model of the Moon
- Book 6 - Eclipses
- Book 7,8 - Star Catalog
- Books 9-13 - Planetary Motion

### Geocentric Model
#### Ptolemy's Planetary Motion
- Elaborated system of Hipparchian epicycles, this explained retrograde motion very well
- Added the equant (mirror image of Earth's position, speed had to appear uniform)
	- Reproduces retrograde motion of planets accurately for the first time
