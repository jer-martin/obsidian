## The Almagest
- Books 1 and 2 - Mathematics (trig), observations of length of year, equinoxes
- Book 3 - Motion of the Sun (used Hipparchus work)
- Books 4 - Moon (Hipparchus, proved that H. model and observations do not agree well, but H had already done that)
- Book 5 - New model of the Moon
- Book 6 - Eclipses
- Book 7,8 - Star Catalog
- Books 9-13 - Planetary Motion

### Geocentric Model
#### Ptolemy's Planetary Motion
- Elaborated system of Hipparchian epicycles, this explained retrograde motion very well
- Added the equant (mirror image of Earth's position, speed had to appear uniform)
	- Reproduces retrograde motion of planets accurately for the first time

#### Shortcomings of Ptolemaic System
*According to ancients...*

- Idea of eccentric or epicycle with nothing at center was problematic - seemed unphysical
- Ptolemy's model for Moon represented motion well, but it was unrealistic: Moon's distance varied by factor of 2 in model, angular size varies only ~10%
- Necessary conditions tied the planets to the Sun to reproduce observations without any logical reason
- Equant violated cardinal principle of Greeks - epicycles motion around deferent not uniform (constant speed) â†’ *most serious defect*

### Appraisal of the *Almagest*
- Highest achievement of Greek astronomy
- Matched observational data very well
- First geometrical model that could be used to make predictions
- Able to reproduce retrograde motion not only in position, but also account for the change in brightness
- Set high standard for theoretical astronomy; not equaled in Europe until much later
- Cause of friction between mathematicians and philosophers:
	- Ptolemy's model admired by math
	- Considered "unphysical" by philosophers


*The model was virtually unchallenged for 1500 years!*
