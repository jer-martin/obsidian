### Patterns of Stars
- A pattern or group of stars in the sky is called a *constellation*
- These constellations have changed very little over human history
- Looking up at the sky, people imagined pictures and grouped these stars together into constellations
	- This helps us remember the patterns of the stars
- *There are a total of 88 constellations!*

- different stars in a constellation may not be close, they only look close when projected on the celestial sphere
- most stars in a constellation are not associated with each other
- constellations are *not* bound by gravity

*Constellations reflect the cultures of the people who created them!*

	- These were hunters, dogs, bears, etc...
	- Adapted later to Greek mythology
