## Patterns of Stars
- A pattern or group of stars in the sky is called a *constellation*
- These constellations have changed very little over human history
- Looking up at the sky, people imagined pictures and grouped these stars together into constellations
	- This helps us remember the patterns of the stars

*There are a total of 88 constellations!*

- different stars in a constellation may not be close, they only look close when projected on the celestial sphere
- most stars in a constellation are not associated with each other
- constellations are *not* bound by gravity

*Constellations reflect the cultures of the people who created them!*

- The oldest constellations used today originated in 3000 BC in Mesopotamia
	- These were hunters, dogs, bears, etc...
	- Adapted later to Greek mythology
- Southern hemisphere constellations originated in the 17th century
	- These were ships, compasses, etc...
	- They were created by sailors

- In mythology, Orion was killed by a scorpion, and due to his hubris, Gaia put the scorpion in the sky across from Orion, so that they could always see each other but never fight.

## Apparent Annual Motion of the Sun
- Because of Earth's orbital motion, the Sun position relative to the stars is different every night
- It moves about 1$\textdegree$ per day. Why?
	- 365 days per year, 360 degrees in a circle = 0.986 degrees/day

- The Zodiac is a band centered on the [ecliptic](NEWTN%2009-01-23%20Lecture%204.md)

- Sky has changed since Babylonians came up with the signs of the Zodiac (due to the precession of Earth)
	- Ex: August 4th is not Leo anymore, but Cancer
- The Sun spends different times in different constellations!
	- Scorpius only 7 days
	- Virgo 47 days
- *Horoscope*
	- constellations used to mark the time
