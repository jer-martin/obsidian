- Bluestone outcrops are formed of natural, vertical pillars that can be removed by inserting wedges into the ready-made joints between pillars.
- 2019 finding shows that stones were quarried at the site about 5000 years ago
- Archaeologists are now evaluating a change in the timeline of the Henge, with the blue stones being placed in the Aubrey holes creating the first Henge and the Sarsen stones arriving later
