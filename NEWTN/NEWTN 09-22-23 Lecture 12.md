### Source of the Sarsen Stones

- Bluestone outcrops are formed of natural, vertical pillars that can be removed by inserting wedges into the ready-made joints between pillars.
- 2019 finding shows that stones were quarried at the site about 5000 years ago
- Archaeologists are now evaluating a change in the timeline of the Henge, with the blue stones being placed in the Aubrey holes creating the first Henge and the Sarsen stones arriving later

	"The principal line of the whole work points to the NE, where the sun is when the days are longer."


### Hawkins's Results
- Midwinter = winter solstice
- Midsummer = summer solstice
- Declinations determine whether the Moon is in a standstill

### Hawkins's Theory on Predicting Eclipses
- At intervals 9,9, 10, 9, 9, 10 place alternating black and white marker stones
- Move them clockwise around the ring one hole per year
- If white marker falls in holes 56, 51, or 5, eclipse is possible that ear
	- For example, white marker at AH56, full moon rises over heel stone

### Hawkins's Most Controversial Result
- Lunar standstills as a tool to predict eclipses
- Aubrey holes could be used with marker stones as a "computer"

### Arguments against Aubrey Holes as "Eclipse Computer"
- Number of holes:
	- 56 holes is practically unique to Stonehenge (other megalithic structures have holes, but different number)
- 56 years is not recognizable as an eclipse cycle
- Standstill cycle is about 18.6 years and cannot be used to make long term predictions of lunar eclipses
	- Metonic cycle (19 years) is much more useful

### Criticism of Hawkins
- Every age has the Ston
