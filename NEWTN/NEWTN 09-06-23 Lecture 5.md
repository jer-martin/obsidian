## Motion of the Sun
- ### Daily Motion
    - caused by Earth's rotation around axis
    - #### Apparent Daily Motion
        - rises in East
        - sets in West
        - travels on arc across the sky
    - #### Solar Day
        - 24 hours
- ### Annual Motion
    - throughout the year, the Sun travels in a path called the [[NEWTN 09-01-23 Lecture 4|ecliptic]]
    - the ecliptic is inclined 23.5$\textdegree$ relative to the [[NEWTN 09-01-23 Lecture 4|Celestial Equator]]
    - on the equinoxes, the ecliptic intersects the equator, so the Sun travels on the CE
    
  1.   *We can tell the Sun moves annually due to the change in rising and setting points*
  2. Variation in Sun's time above horizon + Change in altitude at noon -> insolation

### Insolation:
- Total amount of energy radiated onto the Earth
